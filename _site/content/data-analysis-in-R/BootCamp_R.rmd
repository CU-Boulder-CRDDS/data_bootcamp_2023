# R Foundations

R is one of the most popular programming languages for data science.
This introductory course aims to provide participants an opportunity to
make a start towards learning R for a variety of data science tasks,
include statistical analysis, data visualization, natural language
processing, and others.

By the end of this course and the conjoining set of short courses over
the semester, among several other skills, you will have resources to use
R to visualize distributions of data across categorical groups:

```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(ggstatsplot)
data <- read.csv('musicclassintentions.csv')

ggbetweenstats(
  data = data,
  x = Level,
  y = intentions,
  title = "Distribution of Intentions to Sign Up for Music Across Grade Level"
)
```

Calculate correlation coefficients, and visualize relationships between
your data:

```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(psych)
library(tidyverse)

variablelist <- data %>% select(intentions, values, needs, parentsupport, SESComp)
psych::pairs.panels(variablelist, 
             method = "pearson", # correlation method
             hist.col = "#00AFBB",
             density = TRUE,  # show density plots
             ellipses = TRUE, 
             lm = TRUE# show correlation ellipses
             )
```

Fit General Linear Models (GLM) and produce publishable tables:

```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(broom)

tidy(lm(intentions ~ SESComp + parentsupport + needs + values, data=data)) %>%
  kable(caption = "Estimates for a Model Fitted to Estimate Variation in Music Elective Intentions.",
    col.names = c("Predictor", "B", "SE", "t", "p"),
    digits = c(0, 2, 3, 2, 3))
```

Understand and utilize logistic and linear regression analysis.
Additionally, you will be able to fit, interpret, and visualize
Structural Equation Models (SEM):

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(lavaan)
library(semPlot)

model <- '
  # regressions
    needs ~ parentsupport
    values ~ needs + parentsupport + peersupport
    intentions ~ values + needs + SESComp' 

fit <- sem(model, data=data)

semPaths(fit, what = "path", whatLabels = "std", style = "lisrel", edge.label.cex = .9, rotation = 2, curve = 3, layoutSplit = FALSE, normalize = FALSE, height = 9, width = 6.5, residScale = 10)
```

In addition to each of these tasks, you will also be introduced to both
text and network analysis in R. There will be an informal assessment
tied to each chapter so you can test and apply your skills as you move
through the book.

## Getting Started with R and RStudio

Before we get ahead of ourselves, take a few minutes to download and
install both R and RStudio.

Where R is a programming language, RStudio is an integrated development
environment (IDE) which enables users to efficiently access and view
most facets of the program in a four pane environment. These include the
source, console, environment and history, as well as the files, plots,
packages and help. The console is in the lower-left corner, and this is
where commands are entered and output is printed. The source pane is in
the upper-left corner, and is a built in text editor. While the console
is where commands are entered, the source pane includes executable code
which communicates with the console. The environment tab, in the
upper-right corner displays an list of loaded R objects. The history tab
tracks the user's keystrokes entered into the console. Tabs to view
plots, packages, help, and output viewer tabs are in the lower-right
corner.

Where SPSS and other menu based analytic software are limited by user
input and installed software features, R operates as a mediator between
user inputs and open source developments from our colleagues all over
the world. This affords R users a certain flexibility. However, it takes
a few extra steps to appropriately launch projects. Regardless of your
needs with R, you will likely interact with the following elements of
document set up.

Download R from
[\<https://cran.r-project.org/\>](https://cran.r-project.org/){.uri}
Choose your operating system (Windows, MacOS, or Linux) and download as
you would any other program.

Download the free version of RStudio for your OS from
[\<https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/\>](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/){.uri}
Follow prompts to install.

From the cran project (link for full source:
[\<https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf\>](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf){.uri}):
"When R is running, variables, data, functions, results, etc, are stored
in the active memory of the computer in the form of objects which have a
name. The user can do actions on these objects with operators
(arithmetic, logical,comparison, . . .) and functions (which are
themselves objects)."

### Learning to Read Code

> "Numquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necessitate. Plurality is never
> to be posited without necessity."
>
> William of Occam, circa 1495

The most formidable challenge many new R users face is learning to code.
While coding can seem daunting at first, it is important to remember
that all coding tasks simply involve solutions to problems the user
identifies. No matter how difficult the problem, there are always a lot
of solutions to each problems, and someone else has always encountered
the solution, and likely has posted it to a forum. Occams Razor (i.e.,
the solution with the least amount of assumptions is the best) helps you
identify the problems to solve as you interact with code. For new users,
your breakthrough moment where you start to feel like a programmer might
come from a well-worded google search and a focused effort to solve an
issue with the R programming language. It is, indeed, a language, so
half of the battle is learning to read code in a manner that is
meaningful to you. Throughout this book, you will be provided with
tutorials and suggestions for reading the code you interact with.

### Practices in Reproducability

It is important --- whether you are working alone or with others --- to
adopt a collaboration mindset. This value is clearly important when
working with other statistical collaborators or with domain experts who
do not have experience in R. Even experienced users might become
confused when examining a peer's code. The same effect may occur if you
return to a project after many months, and find yourself lost in your
own code. As such, I recommend utilizing R markdown files (File -\> New
File -\> R Markdown) and comments (\#) to provide notes to yourself and
others who might interact with your code. For instance, this is an R
Markdown document (.Rmd for file extensions). R Markdown is a simple
formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents that
can include blocks of code, as well as space for narrative to describe
the code. For more details on using R Markdown see
<http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the \*\*Knit\*\* button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can quickly insert chunks into your R
Markdown file with the keyboard shortcut Cmd + Option + I (Ctrl + Alt +
I for Windows users). Comments can be utilized within code chunks, and
are not considered a functioning part of the code to R.

```{r}
x <- 10 # This is an example of a comment.
```

No matter what coding format you choose, insert narrative into your
document in a way that makes sense to you. It may be helpful to split
your code up into small, easy to digest chunks as to not become
overwhelmed when examining your work. Lastly, it is also helpful to use
a project specific directory and to frequently save your work.

## Coding in R

### Set Your Working Directory

When you first use R follow this procedure for Windows and MAC OSX:

Create a sub-directory (folder), "R" for example, in your "Documents"
folder. This sub-folder, also known as working directory, will be used
by R to read and save files. Think of it as a downloads folder for R
only.

You can specify your working directory to R in a few ways. Click the
session at the top of your screen and choose your directory. It might
also be useful to change the directory using coding. To do this, use the
function 'setwd', and then enter the location of your directory.

```{r workingdirectory}
#setwd('Users/jacob/R/R Series')
```

### Operators

If this is your first foray into coding, you might think of it as a
conversation you are having with R about a problem you are trying to
solve. You can talk to R using numerical digits and text. Operators are
the symbols that connect your numbers or words with mathematical (e.g.
addition), relational (e.g.\>=), and logical manipulations (e.g.
conditional coding)

To start coding with mathematical operators, enter a number in the code
box below, then click the run button.

```{r number}

```

Now, pick a set of two numerals to sum, placing an addition sign between
them. Then click the run button.

```{r mathematical}
7+2
```

Base R comes with working mathematical operators for addition (+),
subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), division (/), and exponents (\^).
I've left an example for you below. Try making your own.

```{r multiple objects}
7+2-10*40
```

### Functions

Functions allow pieces of your input to be connected. For example, the
sum function adds a set of numbers which are specified within
parenthesis as demonstrated below.

```{r sum function}
sum(2,4)
```

Try to run this set.

```{r sum function error, error = TRUE}
sum(2 4)
```

When the comma is omitted, R returns an error. Fix the example above. If
any part of your code is not correct, your document will not knit
without additional encouragement.

You can sum a sequence, using two vectors separated by the colon
operator (:), as seen below.

```{r sum sequence}
sum(4:20)
```

Base R comes installed with a plethora of functions. R also helps you
find the right function for you. Place your cursor after the function
'seq' but before the first parenthesis, and press tab. Hover over the
function 'seq' in the dropdown list to see a full description. Read the
description and examine the code. What do you think the output will be?

```{r seq help}
seq(from = 0, to = 20, by = 4)
help(seq)
```

Was the output what you expected? The seq function generates a sequence
of numbers. In this example, 0 and 20 are the upper and lower limits of
this sequence. Now, look to the bottom right side RStudio. Since you ran
the entire cell, the command 'help(seq)' launched a search in the R
documentation for the seq function in addition to running the seq
function. Here, we can ascertain that this function takes a set of
arguments (e.g. from = 0, to = 20, by = 4). When you paste that exact
code into the seq function, it generates the same result. Try it!

### Objects

Hold that thought about arguments. To truly appreciate arguments, it's
important to have a working understanding of objects. First, an example
of an object built into base R. The input below is not numeric, but
still represents a number. Run the code, and you will see that the word
'pi' has been assigned the numeric value of pi. This is one of the few
predefined objects in R. For your purposes in using R, you will likely
be making your own.

```{r pi object}
pi 
```

To assign values to objects, as the numerical version of pi was to the
word pi, use the '\<-' operator. For example, the code segment below
assigns the value 50 to the object 'a', and 14 to the object 'b' using
the '\<-' operator. From a code reading perspective, it may be helpful
to read the code out loud, saying a is 50, and b is 14. While this seems
overly simplistic at this stage, objects can be complex.

```{r twoobjects1}
a <- 50
b <- 14 
```

Further, many objects are typically involved in coding. See the code
chunk below for a simple example of the interaction of two objects.

```{r twoobjects2}
a + b
```

Notice that R held the object assignments from the previous cell. You
can also assign a function to an object, and call that object to execute
the function. For instance:

```{r functionobject}
addvalues <- a + b
addvalues
```

The product is not reached because R understands the input 'addvalues',
but because the object add values calls the newly defined function 'a +
b'. Try switching the values of a and b three chunks ago, and running
the subsequent chunks. Remember that objects are case sensitive and
cannot contain spaces. If you ran the code 'A+B', what would happen?

**Why do we not use the equal sign to assign objects?** According to the
R documentation, the "operator \<- can be used anywhere, whereas the
operator = is only allowed at the top level (e.g., in the complete
expression typed at the command prompt) or as one of the subexpressions
in a braced list of expressions".

### Install Packages

Packages are the fundamental unit of shareable code in R. Packages help
standardize tools and conventions and save time. There is a package for
almost anything you can think of. You can make packages yourself if you
find yourself using R for a unique work flow, you might benefit from
creating your own package.

![why make a package](packagetweet.png)

You will not be able to see this screenshot of a tweet in the RMD file
you download, while it will be viewable in the pdf or html knitted
output of this RMD. To upload your own image, move or save a file to
your working directory and use this format.

-   Today we will be focusing on **tidyverse**: The tidyverse
    installation contains multiple R packages that "share an underlying
    design philosophy, grammar, and data structure" (help(tidyverse))
    for the purpose of data wrangling, analysis, and visualization.
    These include ggplot2 for data visualization, dplyr for data
    manipulation, tidyr, readr for , purrr, tibble, stringr, and
    forcats.

-   **fivethirtyeight**: The fivethirtyeight package includes 128
    callable datasets from Nate Silver's statistical analysis website.
    For a full list of datasets, follow this link:
    <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fivethirtyeight/vignettes/fivethirtyeight.html>

To install packages, use the code below. Remember to wrap the package in
quotes when you are installing it.

```{r install packages, echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F, error = T}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("fivethirtyeight")
```

Now call the packages using the library() function. You do not need to
use quotes when calling packages you have already installed.

```{r library}
library(tidyverse)
library(fivethirtyeight)
```

### Import Dataset

We will be using a built-in dataset from the fivethirtyeight package
that contains information on US Births from 1994 to 2003. Call the
dataset with the filename 'US_births_1994_2003' and assign it to the
object 'data' with the operator '\<-'. See the code below.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
data <- US_births_1994_2003
View(data)
```

The head() and tail() functions show the first and last six rows of a
dataframe. Notice that when you run the entire cell, R studio allows you
to scroll through the various outputs.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
head(data)
tail(data)
```

To investigate the names of the columns, run the function colnames().
For a summary of each column of data, call the summary() function. You
can also see the data using view().

```{r data2}
colnames(data)
summary(data)
view(data)
```

## Understanding and Examining Datasets

Most R workflows involve some of these five basic data types. These
include integers (e.g. 2), numeric values (e.g. 2.5), factors or
variables with levels (e.g. gender), logical values (i.e. True/False),
and characters (e.g. "text").

Try running the functions below to examine different facets of the
dataset. To run a single line within a code chunk, highlight the code
you want and press 'command + enter' on mac and 'ctrl + enter' on
windows.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
length(data) # number of elements or components
str(data)    # structure of an object
class(data)  # class or type of an object
names(data)  # column names
```

Sometimes when your data is loaded, R will recognize a column with an
incorrect structure. For example, you can change the data type of the
column 'month' from integer to numeric using the function as.numeric().
The \$ sign allows for the access to columns based on their names in the
dataset.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
data$month <- as.numeric(data$month)
str(data)
```

When operationalizing factors for quantitative data analysis, you might
want to convert a string based factor to numeric values. The code below
converts the string data in day of the week column into a numeric
vector.

```{r}
head(data$day_of_week)
num_day_of_Week <- as.numeric(data$day_of_week)
head(num_day_of_Week)
head(data)
```

Use the unique() function to show the unique values in a column.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Get the unique years of the data
unique(data$year)
```

Compute the mean of a vector.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Compute the average number of births on any day in any year.
mean(data$births)
```

Compute the standard deviation of a vector.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Compute the standard deviation of the number of births in a given day
sd(data$births)
```

Use max() and min() to identify the smallest and largest values in a
column, and quantile() to determine data distributions.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
max(data$births)
min(data$births)
quantile(data$births, probs=c(0.0, 0.33, 0.50, 0.66, 1.0))
```

To get quantiles for births from 1995 alone, create a new object with
filtered data.

```{r}
births_1995 <- filter(data, year==1995)$births
quantile(births_1995)
```

Base R allows you to find the index of one column where a maximum occurs
in another. For example, the following code uses the max() and
which.max() functions to identify the date when the maximum number of
births took place.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Find the date of the maximum births
max(data$births)
maxindex <- which.max(data$births)
maxdate <- data$date[maxindex]
maxdate
```

You can use the filter() function from the tidyverse to achieve the same
result in one line of code.

```{r}
filter(data, births==max(births))
```

We want to find the max number of births for each day of the week for
any year. The answers for Sundays and Mondays are below. Write your own
code in the following code chunk that tells you the same information for
Tuesday and Wednesday Sunday: 8926, August 14th, 1994 Monday: 12967,
December 22nd, 2003 Tuesday: Wednesday:

```{r}
# this is what filter is doing on groups
sundays <- filter(data, day_of_week == 'Sun')
filter(sundays, births==max(births))
mondays <- filter(data, day_of_week == 'Mon')
filter(mondays, births==max(births))
tuesdays <- filter(data, day_of_week == 'Tues')
filter(tuesdays, births==max(births))

```

Use the group_by() function and filter the dataset by max births to
display the max number of births on each day of the week for any year.

```{r}
data_grouped <- group_by(data, day_of_week)
filter(data_grouped, births==max(births))
```

You can also group by more than one column.

```{r}
# Add year as another grouping variable
data_grouped <- group_by(data, day_of_week, year)
data_max_day_year <- filter(data_grouped, births==max(births))
data_max_day_year
```

Now we can use ggplot to visualize the max births by weekday over time.
To write the edited dataset use the write_csv() function.

```{r}
ggplot(data_max_day_year, aes(x = year, y = births, colour = day_of_week)) +
  geom_line() +
  ylab("Max births") +
  ylim(c(0,15000))

write_csv(data_max_day_year, "max_births_per_dayofweek_per_year.csv")
```

## Data Wrangling

There are many useful functions for altering your data frame. In this
section you will start to see the %\>% operator. You can read this
operator as the word 'then' when you are reading code to yourself (e.g.
take the original dataset, then arrange it by births in descending
order)

You can use this operator to apply functions to your dataset. For
instance, order the data frame by a certain column (default is ascending
order).

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Order by number of births
data <- data %>% arrange(desc(births))
head(data)
```

```{r}
data <- data %>% arrange(year)
head(data)
```

Rename specific columns of your data without opening and editing the
file.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Rename day_of_month and day_of_week columns
data <- data %>% rename(day = date_of_month, weekday = day_of_week)
head(data)
```

Select rows of a data frame based on a certain condition. Use the dim()
function to ascertain the dimensions of the resultant dataset.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Select days only in the month of July and do the same for Jan
july_data <- data %>% filter(month == 7)
jan_data <- data %>% filter(month == 1)
# Select days only in the month of january in the year 2000
jan_2000_data <- data %>% filter(month == 1 & year == 2000)
dim(jan_2000_data)
```

Filter out the data for the first half of the year (January through
June).

```{r}
janthrujune <- data %>% filter(month == 1:6)
min(janthrujune$month)
janthrujune
```

Select specific columns of a data frame using the select() function

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Select days only the columns of date and births
selected_data <- data %>% select(date, births)
selected_data
```

Separate one column into several.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Separate date of selected_data into 3 columns
parsed_data <- selected_data %>% separate(date, c('y','m','d'))
parsed_data
```

You can also add an additional column to the data frame.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Create a column that indicates if it is a summer month (June, July, August).
data <- data %>% mutate(summer = between(month,6,8))
str(data)
```

And compute summary statistics of your data frame.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Compute the mean number of births for a given day
overall_mean <- data %>% summarise(average = mean(births))
```

Grouping by columns to calculate summary statistics.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Compute the mean and median number of births by weekday
weekday_mean <- data %>%
  group_by(weekday) %>%
  summarise(average = mean(births))

weekday_median <- data %>%
  group_by(weekday) %>%
  summarise(median = median(births))

#join
meansandmedians <- right_join(weekday_mean, weekday_median, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, suffix = c(".x", ".y"))
meansandmedians
```

Bind two dataframes together by row.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Bind data frames by row
janjul_data <- jan_data %>%
  bind_rows(july_data)
tail(janjul_data)
```

Bind two dataframes together by similar columns.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Join two data frames together
joined_data <- jan_data %>%
  left_join(july_data, by = c("year","day"))
tail(joined_data)
```

Separate multiple columns into one.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Select days only in the month of July
gathered_data <- joined_data %>%
  gather(key = month, value = births, c("births.x","births.y"))
# key: column name representing new variable
# value: column name representing variable values
# remaining: columns to gather
```

Save the data frame to a .csv file.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
write_csv(gathered_data, "gathered.csv")
```

## Data for Visualization

We will be working with a dataset from the fivethrityeight package
again. If you have not yet installed this package, run
"install.packages("fivethiryeight")" in the R-console. You will also
need the "ggpubr" package. This will allow us to plot multiple plots on
the same figure. Now let's load our libraries. If you do not have the
packages already, install the tidyverse, fivethirtyeight, and ggpubr
packages.

The tidyverse installation contains multiple R package for the purpose
of data wrangling, analysis, and visualization. These include ggplot2
for data visualization, dplyr for data manipulation, tidyr, readr for ,
purrr, tibble, stringr, and forcats. The fivethirtyeight package
includes 128 callable datasets from Nate Silver's statistical analysis
website. For a full list of datasets, follow this link:
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fivethirtyeight/vignettes/fivethirtyeight.html>

ggpubr includes tools for creating publishable plots, making it easy to
annotate and arrange multiple plots. Install any packages that you need,
and then load the libraries using the next two code chunks.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
#install.packages("ggpubr")
#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("fivethirtyeight")
```

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(ggpubr)
```

We are going to start with data regarding the Bechdel test, which
measures the representation of women in fictional films. Films that pass
the Bechdel test will feature at least two women who talk to each other
about something other than a man. Roughly half of films pass the test,
however, films that do tended to earn more money than films that failed.
Let's explore and visualize this dataset to see the extent to which
financial and other implications can be identified.

First, load the data, assigning it to the object 'bech_data'. Then look
at the dataset using the View() and str(), short for structure,
functions.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
bech_data <- bechdel
View(bech_data)
str(bech_data)
bech_data
```

The columns in the data set include the imdb code, title, financial
information, as well as the year, decade code, and period code. To
create pragmatic visualizations of financial data, it will be useful to
rescale the columns such that the values are displayed in millions of
dollars, rather than dollars. Simply use mathematical operators (e.g.,
data\$column/20) on the columns of interest, and call back the edited
columns to their original names. Make sure you do not run this chunk
more than once. What would happen?

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
bech_data$budget <- bech_data$budget/1000000
bech_data$domgross <- bech_data$domgross/1000000

## Quick Plots

Now that we are familiar with our data, let's start of with some qplots.
The 'q' stands for quick in qplots. This is just a way to produce quick
plots for on-the-fly data visualization. We highly recommend you use the
ggplot method of plotting, which we will begin covering in the next
section and spend most of today working with. However, quick plots can
be useful at times.

There are four key arguments to consider when creating a qplot. These
are data, where you define your dataset, x and y, where you define the x
and y variables respectively, and geom, which dictates the geometry of
your plot. Geom options include point, line, smooth, dotplot, boxplot,
violin, histogram, and density

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F, eval = F}
qplot(data = "data_frame", x = "x_variable", y = "y_variable", geom = "whatever_plot_you_want")
```

Let's try a few examples.

The following code will produce a set of boxplots describing the
distributions of movie budgets disaggregated by year. R treats column
data, such as the year column, as a single vector. Set the year column
as a factor within the x argument using the as.factor() function. What
does the second plot tell you that the first one fails to communicate?

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
qplot(data = bech_data, x = year, y= domgross, geom = 'boxplot')
qplot(data = bech_data, x = as.factor(year), y= domgross, geom = 'boxplot')
```

Period codes were included in the dataset to compare movies which were
released in the same time period. Data included movies from 1970 to
2013, which were categorized into five period codes. Let's group the
domestic gross values by period codes to compare the distributions of
film's earnings over time. Let's also compare boxplots to violin plots,
which show the full distribution of data instead of the plotting summary
statistics. What do violin plots tell you that boxplots fail to capture?

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
qplot(data = bech_data, x = period_code, y= domgross, group=period_code, geom = 'boxplot')
qplot(data = bech_data, x = period_code, y= domgross, group=period_code, geom = 'violin')
```

## Plotting with ggplot

Now let's start using ggplot. We have much more flexibility with the
ggplot framework. Let's make the same violin plot for period_code as we
did in the qplot using ggplot.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F, eval = F}
ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = as.factor(period_code), y = domgross)) +
  geom_violin()
```

Using ggplot, we can dive deep into histograms and density plots. These
particular visualizations provide insight at a glance for the
distributions of data across several groups. To start, let's create a
histogram of the domestic gross revenue.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = domgross)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

Now let's add some bells and whistles using ggplot's layers-based coding
to make this visualization more readable and appealing.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = domgross, fill=binary)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha=0.8, colour = 'grey') +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Movies in FiveThirtyEight Bechdel Dataset") +
  xlab('Domestic Gross in Millions') +
  ylab('Density') +
  labs(fill = 'Bechdel Test')
```

You can specify the color (outline) and fill color of plots. You can
also assign ggplots to objects. The gpubr function ggarrange() allows
you to easily present multiple plots in the same output.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
color <- ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = domgross, y = ..density..)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = 'blue') + 
  ggtitle("Outlining the histogram") + 
  xlab("Domestic Gross Revenue")

fill <- ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = domgross, y = ..density..)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = 'green') + 
  ggtitle("Filling the histogram") + 
  xlab("Domestic Gross Revenue")

ggarrange(color, fill)
```

You can vary the number of bins in each histogram. Run the following
chunk to see the implications of the bin argument.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Vary the number of bins per histogram
bin60 <- ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = domgross, y = ..density..)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 60) + 
  ggtitle("60 bins") + 
  xlab("Domestic Gross Revenue")
bin30 <- ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = domgross, y = ..density..)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) + 
  ggtitle("30 bins") + 
  xlab("Domestic Gross Revenue")
bin15 <- ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = domgross, y = ..density..)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 15) + 
  ggtitle("15 bins") + 
  xlab("Domestic Gross Revenue")

ggarrange(bin60, bin30, bin15, ncol = 3)
```

The density plot is a variation of the histogram, where values in
columns are smoothed to be equally distributed. You can use
geom_density() to add a density plot on top of a histogram. The alpha
argument refers to the opacity of the following argument, fill, where
you define the color of the density plot.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Add a density plot
ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = domgross, y = ..density..)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 60, color = 'grey', fill = 'blue') + 
  ggtitle("Distibution of Domestic Gross Revenue for Movies") + 
  xlab("Domestic Gross Revenue") + 
  geom_density(alpha = .4, fill = 'grey')
```

You can also create histograms to compare multiple groups within a
single plot. Try switching the color argument with the fill argument,
keeping the object binary in place. See if you can apply what you have
learned so far to improve the appeal of the plot.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = domgross, y = ..density.., fill = binary)) + 
  geom_histogram(position = "identity", bins = 60, alpha = .5) + 
  ggtitle("Distibution of Domestic Gross Revenue for Movies") + 
  xlab("Domestic Gross Revenue") + 
  geom_density(alpha = .4)
```

Change the legend title using the layer scale_color_discrete() and the
name argument.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Change legend title
ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = domgross, y = ..density.., color = binary)) + 
  geom_histogram(position = "identity", bins = 60, alpha = .5) + 
  ggtitle("Distibution of Domestic Gross Revenue for Movies") + 
  xlab("Domestic Gross Revenue") + 
  geom_density(alpha = .4) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Test")
```

Use ggsave() and set the desired filename, size, dpi, and other
parameters for saving your plot.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Save your plot
ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = domgross, y = ..density.., color = binary)) + 
  geom_histogram(position = "identity", bins = 60, alpha = .5) + 
  ggtitle("Distibution of Domestic Gross Revenue for Movies") + 
  xlab("Domestic Gross Revenue") + 
  geom_density(alpha = .4) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Test") +
  ggsave("Hist_Dens.png", width = 5, height = 5)
```

Let's create some more box plots and violin plots using the period code
column. As these plots are used to compare distributions of data, they
are especially useful for comparing different groups of continuous data.
You can use the mutate() function to set period_code as a factor, as to
make your ggplot coding simpler and cleaner. In this iteration, let's
set try a notched box plot, which emphasize the median with notches.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
bech_data <- bech_data %>% mutate(period_code = as.factor(period_code))

ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = period_code, y= domgross)) + 
  geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE)
```

You can add a dot to represent the mean domestic revenue for each group
of movies using stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "point", color =
"anycolor")

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = period_code, y = domgross)) + 
  geom_boxplot(notch = T) + 
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "point", color = 'red')
```

Assign period_code to the argument color to assign each period code a
unique color.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = period_code, y= domgross, color = period_code)) + 
  geom_boxplot(notch = T) + 
  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="point", color = 'red')
```

*If you need another task while the class is progressing, add a title,
change the axis labels, and change the legend title to the last plot
that we made.*

You can create make group comparisons using box plots. Use the aes()
function to specify the group using the color or fill argument, and the
variables of interest using the x and y arguments. Instead of outlining
this boxplot in color, fill the boxplot in color. Add a legend title.
Use the layer "scale_fill_discrete" when "fill" is used in the aes. Use
the layer "scale_color_discrete" when "color" is used in the aes.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = period_code, y = domgross, color = binary)) + 
  geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE)
```

Scatter plots are useful for visualizing how two sets of continuous data
are related. Let's plot domestic gross revenue vs. international gross
revenue in the Bechdel dataset.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = domgross, y = intgross)) + 
  geom_point()
```

You can change the size, shape, and color of points in your scatter
plot.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = domgross, y = intgross)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2, shape = 6, color = 'blue')
```

To label the points that represent top five movies based on
international gross revenue, first arrange the international gross
revenue column in descending order, using the slice() function to limit
the dataframe to the top five movies. Then, add an addition geom_point()
layer calling the topfive data, as shown below.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
topfive <- bech_data %>%
  arrange(desc(intgross)) %>%
  slice(1:5)

ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = domgross, y = intgross)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_point(data=topfive, aes(x=domgross, y = intgross), color = 'red') +
  geom_text(data=topfive, label = topfive$title, nudge_y = 100)
```

Add a regression line to any scatter plot with geom_smooth(method =
'lm').

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = domgross, y = intgross)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

If you need another task, change the color to red and linetype to dashed
in the previous scatter plot.

You can also display scatter plots by groups, distinguished by color or
shape, as seen below. See if you can add a regression line to one of
these plots.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Scatter plot by group
plot1 <- ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = domgross, y = intgross, color = binary)) + 
  geom_point()
plot2 <- ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = domgross, y = intgross, shape = binary)) + 
  geom_point()

ggarrange(plot1,plot2,ncol=2)
```

You can also add rugs, or lines across the x-axis that are tied to
single points of data, to the plot using geom_rug().

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Add rugs to scatter plot
ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = domgross, y = intgross, color = binary)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_rug()
```

You can also create bar plots, or jitter plots. The bar plot below gives
an indication of the extent to which each reason for failing was given,
as well as how many times a movie passed the test. The jitter plot,
however, shows the individual points from the dataset as they relate to
the binary column mapped to the y-axis.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = clean_test)) + 
  geom_bar()

ggplot(data = bech_data, aes(x = clean_test, y = binary)) + 
  geom_jitter()
```
