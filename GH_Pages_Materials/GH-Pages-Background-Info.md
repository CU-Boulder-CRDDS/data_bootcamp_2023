# Background information  

## Git & GitHub  
First of all, if you're new to Git and GitHub, here are a few helpful resources.  


* ### [What is Git (in a nutshell)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F)
  - If you're totally new to Git, then I recommend reading over this.
  - Contains a lot of the basic concepts and terminology.  
* ### [Introduction to the Command Line](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash)
  - For folks new to the command line, this is a great introduction.
  - Includes fundamentals like navigating your file system through the command line interacting with files, plus a handy command reference guide.  
* ### [What is GitHub?](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
  - A quick guide to the basics of GitHub.
  - Creating a repository, commits, branches, pull requests.

## GitHub Pages & Jekyll

* ### [What is GitHub Pages?](https://pages.github.com/)

* ### [Jekyll Home & Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/)  

* ### [GitHub Pages Supported Themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/)
  - This is helpful if you need to get into the details of a theme or to troubleshoot problems if you've switched themes.

* ### [Remote Themes](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme)
  - Even more themes for your pages site...
  - But your mileage may vary when using remote themes. You may want to clone the whole repo rather than adding using the `remote_theme` option in your _comfig.yml file.

* ### [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

## Just a great tutorial

* ### [Building a static website with Jekyll and Github Pages](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages)
  - This guide has a lot of great background info for beginners, particularly some of the tools you might want as you get more comfortable.
  - These are very good instructions for getting Ruby and Jekyll up and running locally for both Windows and Mac users.

## A few tech recommendations

* ### [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - Well, obviously. For the hands on portion of this exercise, you don't need it... but you should install Git anyway if you don't have it.
  - Windows users: Git comes with Git Bash, a Linux-style command prompt (aka "shell" aka "terminal"), which will make life easier.
