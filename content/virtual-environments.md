# Virtual Environments

Using the CRDDS Research Data Bootcamp JupyterHub:

**Step 1:** Navigate to https://jupyterhub-crdds-colorado.org

**Step 2:** Login with your Github credentials

**Step 3:** Click "Launch Server" then choose which notebook type you want to open (rstudio or python), and click "Start".

**Step 4:** You will now be in the JupyterLab interface.

*4A:* If you chose a "python" notebook, you can simply open a *.ipynb file or click the "Python 3" button on the RHS of the screen to open a Jupyter notebook.  All of the packages needed for this workshop have been pre-installed.

OR: 

*4B:* If you chose the "rstudio" notebook option, there is no need to click buttons -- just manually change "lab" to "rstudio" in the URL bar of your browser. For example:

Change:
https://jupyterhub-crdds-colorado.org/user/janedoe/lab/workspaces/auto-F

To:
https://jupyterhub-crdds-colorado.org/user/janedoe/rstudio

....this will take you to the familiar Rstudio interface.  All of the packages needed for this workshop have been pre-installed.
