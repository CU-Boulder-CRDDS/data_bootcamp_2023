# Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behavior that is disrespectful to our teachers or learners or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.

In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment, we encourage the following kinds of behaviors in all Bootcamp-related activities and interactions:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the community
* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
* Causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
* Violent threats or language directed against another person
the display of sexual or violent images
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
* Sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
insults or put downs
* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
* Excessive swearing
* Incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
* Continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
publication of private communication without consent


Bootcamp participants are required to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all Bootcamp-related activities. If you believe someone has this Code of Conduct in any way, please contact one of the Bootcamp Coordinators. CRDDS reserves the right to expel any participant from the Bootcamp for a Code of Conduct violation.

This Code of Conduct has been adapted from the Carpentries' [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).
