# Land acknowledgement

Before beginning the workshop, we'd like to acknowledge the indigenous lands upon which our institution resides.    

The University of Colorado Boulder is located on the territories of the Núu-agha-tʉvʉ-pʉ̱ (Ute), Cheyenne, Arapahoe, and Očhéthi Šakówiŋ (Sioux) peoples. 48 contemporary tribal nations are historically tied to the lands that make up Colorado.
