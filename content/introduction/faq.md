# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

As the Bootcamp proceeds, please note any of your questions in the Zoom chat. If we note a pattern of recurring questions, we will attempt to address those questions on this page, which will be preserved as a resource for future learners.

**I'm trying to unzip the file for the python session but getting an inappropriate file or format error**

If you are working from a Mac this may be an error in the zip funtion. Check out this solution for unzipping from the terminal: [https://softwaretested.com/mac/what-is-error-79-inappropriate-file-type-or-format/](https://softwaretested.com/mac/what-is-error-79-inappropriate-file-type-or-format/). 

If that's not working, consider using the virtual environment set up by Research Computing for the Boot Camp.
