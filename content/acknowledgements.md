# Acknowledgements

This website was built by adapting a template that Evan Thornberry (UBC) and Phil White (CU Boulder) developed and presented at a workshop for the Western Association of Map Libraries. Their template was heavily influenced by the University of British Columbia Library Research Commons, and several UBC affiliates contributed to the template's styling  and example pages--particularly [Evan Thornberry](https://github.com/ect123). The template uses the
[Just The Docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) Jekyll theme. The repository containing Phil and Evan's template is available [here](https://github.com/outpw/workshop-template) and you can view the rendered version [here](https://outpw.github.io/workshop-template/). Many thanks to Phil and Evan for making this resource available to the community of librarians and educators.

We would also like to thank Noah Geisel, Thea Lindquist, and Robert McDonald for assistance with developing the Bootcamp's microcredential; Cindy Edgar for assistance with planning, organizing, and advertising the initial version of Bootcamp; Mark Locy for assistance with advertising and promotion; and CU Boulder Research Computing (particularly Andy Monaghan and Andrew Wilson) for assistance with setting up virtual environments.
