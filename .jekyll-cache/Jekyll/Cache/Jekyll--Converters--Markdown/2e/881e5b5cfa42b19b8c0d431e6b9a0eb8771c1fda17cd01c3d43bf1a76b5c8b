<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>As data-based research becomes a common practice, skills in data management, data analysis, and computational thinking are increasingly important for applied researchers. The Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarshipâ€™s Graduate Student Research Data Bootcamp aims to provide incoming and continuing graduate students with a gentle introduction to data and programming-related research tools that will increase their access to cutting-edge methods as they begin their programs and research. Topics covered include data management and data storage; tools for collaboration and sharing  (using GitHub and GitHub Pages); qualitative data; data ethics; data analysis and visualization fundamentals in Python and R; and an overview of data publishing and data management.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the Bootcamp, participants are invited to earn a Bootcamp-related microcredential that certifies their competence in the topics that are covered. We will provide more information about this opportunity on the final day of the Bootcamp.</p>
